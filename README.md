# plotter
This is a simple two arm plotter based on the arduino uno.
The processing-script gernates a gcode-file from a given .svg file and supplies the commands to the arduino (or similar) via its serial port.

The test.txt file is the g-code file generated from the test.svg file.

Please feel free to adapt the code to your personal requirements!
